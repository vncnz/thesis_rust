This is a private project.

## TODOs
- [x] Protect best node from pruning
- [x] Redo pruning on max_pos after change
- [ ] Extensive tests on this part before continue
- [ ] Update thesis wrt updates in code

- [ ] Node collapsing: avoid node repeating "inline". Instead of check recursively like done in python I can touch/verify the element on that the tree pruning stops (?)
- [ ] Non-branching nodes: move them in a dedicated structure property
